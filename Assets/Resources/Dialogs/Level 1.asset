  - Welcome to the Hex Isles!
  - At this delightfully geometrical place live the Hexagons.
  - They came here a long time ago, after they were exiled from cube country because
    they looked too much like circles.
  - Before that, they had lived in the sphere society until they were eventually
    kicked out for not being round enough.
  - Nowadays they spend most of their time hopping around the islands and collecting
    flags.
  - You should help 'em.
